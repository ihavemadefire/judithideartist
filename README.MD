This is a portfolio website for local artist (and my mom) Judith Ide. It uses HTML and CSS/Bootstrap. On the main page there is an image carousell. Each series page contains a gallery of all the paintings within a particular series. 

## Tech stack        

|           |      |
|-----------|------|
| Framework  | HTML |
| CSS Library | Bootstrap |
| Deployment | NGINX web server via Digital Ocean |


| Implemented | Not implemented Yet |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Front end proof of concept | Review and improve design choices |
| Live deploy through digital ocean| Refactor with React |
| Bash script built for easy github integration | Add a CMS |


## Biggest challenges
Deciding not to use a a framework on this seemed like the easy way to go at the begining, but, not being able to use jinja templates or reusable React components definitely led to the html getting unwieldy. This project would be a great candidate for a static react generating framework like Gatsby.

## DevOps Note
- Whenever any changes have been pushed to the github repo, ssh into the server and run the following script
`/var/www/judithideartist.com/updatescript`
